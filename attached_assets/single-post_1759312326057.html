      Cloud adoption continues to accelerate, but many enterprises still find their migration
      initiatives stalling or failing outright. Based on my experience leading transformation
      programs, here are the five most common reasons migrations fail – and practical steps
      to avoid them:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Lack of Executive Alignment</h3>
    <p>Without clear sponsorship and buy-in across CXO stakeholders, cloud initiatives lose
    direction and accountability.</p>

    <h3>2. Incomplete Discovery</h3>
    <p>Enterprises often underestimate the complexity of existing workloads. A thorough
    discovery process is non-negotiable.</p>

    <h3>3. Misaligned Timelines</h3>
    <p>Unrealistic expectations can lead to rushed decisions, increased costs, and technical debt.</p>

    <h3>4. Insufficient Change Management</h3>
    <p>Cloud is as much about people and processes as technology. Training, culture, and workflows
    must evolve in parallel.</p>

    <h3>5. Neglecting Security & Compliance</h3>
    <p>Security should not be a bolt-on – it must be designed into the landing zone and migration
    strategy from day one.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Cloud migration is not a project. It’s a journey of organizational change, requiring
      clarity, patience, and foresight.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      By addressing these areas, enterprises can transform migration from a high-risk challenge
      into a strategic advantage.
