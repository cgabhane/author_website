# Chetan Gabhane Professional Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project is Chetan Gabhane's professional portfolio, showcasing his work as a Cloud & AI Evangelist, Author, and Strategic Advisor. It features his publications, thought leadership, speaking topics, and contact information. The site is a full-stack application with a React frontend and Express backend, designed to be clean and sophisticated, drawing inspiration from professional author portfolios. The business vision is to establish a strong online presence, enhance his personal brand, and generate leads for media inquiries and consulting opportunities.

## User Preferences
- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language.

- **Content Guidelines**: 
  - Use general frameworks and educational content (not employer-specific data)
  - Keep examples anonymized or hypothetical
  - Focus on thought leadership, not consulting during work hours
  - Time-efficient strategies for side hustle (limited hours available)
